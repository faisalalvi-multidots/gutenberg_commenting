# WP Gutenberg Commenting Feature

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This is a beta version. Use it for contributions only.


Welcome to the Gutenberg's Commenting Feature Plugin's repository. This plugin is useful to enable commenting featured like Google Document within WordPress' Gutenberg Block Editor!

Current trends say that 35% of the web uses WordPress, from individual blog posts to big news sites online. While preparing any blog or news online, those people thought of in their mind to verify their content with friends, colleagues, subject experts before posting it. s/he wants to invite and collaborate them in blog posts for review/validation. But, Those people have not any handy feature to give feedback/suggestions right away on those blogs within the WordPress platform.

So, we are happy to announce that we have launched the pre-alpha/Alpha/Beta version of Comment & Markup features. It is available publicly for the community to contribute.

## The Inspiration - 1
 
 One day our team is working on the client‚Äôs project. There are 2 developers working/Editing on the same post and WordPress default behavior ‚ÄúTake Over‚Äù control come to their screens. At that time, we think about if the same post will be managed by more than one person than it would be a great idea. We identify that we should introduce a collaborative mode on the WordPress post/page. We have also studied and done research on the internet. There are a couple of folks and companies in the WordPress community who are contributing to this area. We have started a journey to build this feature and think of giving back to the community.
 
## The Inspiration - 2 

We have one client who is running the business where their people are writing the whitepaper. They need some editorial flow similar to Google Doc. where every assigned user collaboratively works on the same post at the same time. This is our inspiration to develop this type of plugin/tool.

## Why we Started 

It is a great idea to switch to Gutenberg Editor. But, when you switch to Gutenberg Editor, the content of classic editor will not be editable with the new Editor. To make it work, it is required to convert your content to Gutenberg compatible block. That is the problem we are trying to solve with the "Convert Classic Editor to Gutenberg Blocks" script. üí≠

## Solution

We have done research with the client and identify their specific need. Based on that we came with a solution where we will provide comments and markups with a native Gutenberg editor in WordPress Platform. Here, every user will provide comments and markup on any Gutenberg block. Below are the steps to take early advantage of this feature, and we welcome the community people to contribute as well.
